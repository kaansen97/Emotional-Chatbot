He ignores that which is eternal . Horrible how many people do that .

- Doug is only my stepson . I didn 't get him till he was a teenager . By that time , he was hard to reach . I tried , though . I 've had success with other people , like Sara here . But , uh , as far as the last time we saw him ...
- Well , Doug hasn 't been here for over three years .
- And you never filed a missing persons report ?
- Only came when he needed money . The last time he was here , he was different . He wasn 't worried as much and he said everything was gonna be okay .

- Stiviletto 's the guy . Well , maybe . But there 's a number that started showing up in Lauryn 's phone records about two months before she disappeared . It 's from a group of cell phones that belong to The Bready .
- That 's where her mother worked . No surprise there . Well , this specific number belonged to the president of the factory .
- John Haplin ?

- You don 't think John Haplin 's the other man ?
- If he took Lauryn , that would explain how her hand turned up at the bread factory .
- Well , if he took Lauryn , and if we 're right , and the same guy took all the other victims ...
- But why would he take his own kid ?
- Because that 'd be the perfect way to place yourself above suspicion . If the Magic Man took your kid , well , then hell , you couldn 't be the Magic Man .
