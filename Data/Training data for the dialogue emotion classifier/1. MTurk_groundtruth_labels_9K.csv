Well , the victim was last seen leaving Morty 's bar at 1 : 30 , so we can lose all the gunfire prior to that .
As well as where the arrests were made .
That leaves us with two .
Hopefully not after I run the gunshots through the sound-forging software . Now we just plot the decibels as a function of frequency .
And what exactly are we watching for ? The frequencies at which the two gunshots came in . Small-caliber firearms tend to have higher decibels , but not so much in the lower frequencies . So the fact that the first shot had a higher decibel in the lower frequency means it came from a large-caliber weapon ? And since our victim was shot with a small-caliber gun ... Means we found where the victim was murdered . ShotSpotter 's accurate up to ten feet , so the murder had to have taken place somewhere around here .

Why won 't you believe me ?
All right Let us assume that I do believe you .
Who is Bartolomew ? Where is he ? What 's in it for me ?
A way out . I don 't trust you .
Your problem . Why trust you ?
I 've got the gun . Bartolomew was just a code name . Yes ?
Well , I 'm not sure who he was . End of conversation . No , wait . Don 't shoot . Bartolomew was Central Security 's top agent .
So you said . No one knew who he was . No one was safe from him . He was free to hunt anyone in or out of the service . He could watch you , and if he didn 't like what he saw ... Paranoia is the occupational hazard of the torturer . Bartolomew was real . Was real ?
One of the first targets of the Rebellion was Central Security . Their mistake was their obsession with revenge . When they finished kicking the corpses , they 'd lost their chance . The President had regrouped her forces .
You 're saying Bartolomew was one of the corpses they were kicking ?
No , I don 't think so , if I escaped , why shouldn 't he ?
You 're wasting my time , Shrinker . Ifs are no use to me or to you , either . No , wait , please . I 've got a name . A name ?
I had to question a controller from Central ... when I was with the rebels ... So that 's how you escaped . When the rebels lost , you changed sides yet again .
No one could accuse you of being doctrinaire , could they ? Why didn 't the controller recognise you ? Why should he ?
The elite from Central didn 't mix with the interrogation division . Their fastidiousness did them credit . Somebody 's got to do the lousy jobs . Life is cruel , isn 't it ?
Spare me the rationalisations . Just give me the name .
Councillor Chesku .
The controller told you that that was who Bartolomew was ?
Not exactly . What exactly ?
I 'd finished questioning him , he was dying ... and suddenly I got curious ... so I hit him with one last order , "" Identify Bartolomew "" . And he said , "" Councillor Chesku is still "" ... and then he died .
Chesku . He 's one of Servalan 's closest advisors . She 'd know the answer , why don 't you ask her ?
I might just do that .
Are you ready to bring me up ? Ready when you are . Stand by . We had a deal .
Did we ? A way out . You promised me . And I 'm a man of my word . In the end , that 's all there is , really .

Because he is a key witness in this trial . As his statement conflicts with mine , a cross - examination is necessary . Then this request will be determined later .
Are you repeating the original case again ?
Whenever PARK ... Let 's just get this over with first . The Defense motions for a blood - stain verification . We would like to verify whether the blood - stains match PARK 's .
Are you suggesting they aren 't the victim 's ?
You accept everything presented by Prosecution without a doubt while questioning all our requests ... Mr. KIM . Please don 't cut me off when I 'm speaking . According to Article 132 in the Rules of Criminal Procedures , when a prosecutor enters a request for evidence , the correlation between evidence and fact must be specified . But ...
Then , are you saying the blood on the clothes evidence cannot be verified ?
Blood - stain verification is basic forensic procedure .
Counsel , why are you bringing this up now and not during the original trial ?
I wasn 't there at that time . This trial can proceed without a blood - stain verification . According to a written expert 's opinion , That 's why we should confirm if that man is PARK Bongju or not .
What is the Prosecution 's opinion ?
Since it 's clear the victim was wounded by a crossbow , the State considers this procedure unnecessary . Mr. KIM . I would like to ask you a question .
Wasn 't the victim 's injury inflicted by your crossbow ?
No , your Honor .
Then how did the victim get injured ?
The hospital clearly verifies the injury and treatment he received .
Are you saying the paramedics , doctors and others are all lying ?
Yes , your Honor . PARK has originally stated the broken arrow as evidence . But Prosecution has presented an intact one instead . Can 't you see someone is lying ?
Then we 'll probably get some answers when witness LEE Jongguk is cross - examined in the next trial .
Then , what about summoning PARK and the blood - stain verification ?
Those will be postponed .
You 're postponing both ?
Further consideration will be given to this matter . The first 1 19 paramedic to see the wound , KWON Changduk . The patrol officer who collected the arrow , LEE Jongguk . The police officer who filed the police report , HONG Sukjun . The doctor who treated the victim , PARK Jaeki . These four are confirmed as witnesses to take the stand . Requests for PARK Bongju and the blood - stain verification are postponed . This court is adjourned .
