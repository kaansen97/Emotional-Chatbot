The clinic criticized me for working a pregnant woman at night . I was amazed . Kati refused to discuss it with me . She accused me of stealing Hesselbart 's plans .

- He squired ladies . He perfumed and powdered himself , and offered his arm to the noble women of Bologna , for the ball of the sirens , or the procession of the Madonna . He was in great demand . Then he aged and they wanted escorts with smoother skin . But women weren 't his only interest ... He studied as well .

- Why did Mr. Fujii plan this ? Two explanations are conceivable . One : Yukiko Tashiro is a person of special importance to Mr. Fujii . For example , she may be his illegitimate child .
- Mr. Fujii acted upon Mrs. Satoe Kawahara 's request . The two may have wanted Yukiko Tashiro to be heir .
- You 're wrong . I don 't know anything . In which case , Mr. Fujii alone will be charged with fraud .
- You 're lying , Satoe . You knew about it . She knew everything . We planned it together .
- Fujii . It 's not fair .
- Don 't play innocent now . We understand . Please be quiet , both of you . Now that this fraud has been exposed , Yukiko Tashiro 's heirship must be revoked by the executor . There 's a party who engineered this fraud to name Yukiko as heir . Mrs. Satoe attempted to attain the designation as her guardian . She , too , will naturally lose her right of inheritance . It can 't be . That 's ridiculous . How can I lose my inheritance right ?
- I am the legal wife of Senzo . I have the right to one third , no matter what . No matter what "" isn 't accurate . Please look at this .
- Article 891 . The following parties must not be an heir . Look at Clause 4 . If a person , by means of fraud or intimidation , forces the decedent to draw up , cancel , or change the last will and testament regarding inheritance .
